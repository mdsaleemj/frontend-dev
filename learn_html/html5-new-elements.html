			font size, unless you override that setting with a style sheet.

        <h4>HTML5 Tweaked Elements - address|cite|a(link) </h4>
        <p>&lt;Address&gt; Element - element has the narrow purpose of providing contact information for the creator of the HTML document, usually as an email address or website link.(Not suitable for postal address)</p>

        Our Web site is managed by:
        <address>
        	<a href="mailto:jsolo@mysite.com">John Solo</a>,

        <p>&lt;a&gt; Element - A more significant tweak affects the &lt;a&gt;  element for creating links. Past versions of HTML have allowed the &lt;a&gt;  element to hold clickable text or a clickable image. In HTML5, the &lt;a&gt; element allows anything and everything, which means it’s perfectly acceptable to stuff entire paragraphs in there, along with lists, images, and so on. (If you do, you’ll see that all the text inside becomes blue and underlined, and all the images inside sport blue borders.) Web browsers have supported this behavior for years, but it’s only HTML5 that makes it an official, albeit not terribly useful, part of the HTML standard. </p> 

        <a href="#">The link content can be any anything like list element ,image 
        	<ul style="margin:0;padding:0">
        	<li>Simple Link </li>
        	</ul>
        </a>

       <h4>Standardized Elements - embed|wbr</h4>
       <p>
       		&lt;wbr&gt; Element -  indicates an optional word break—in other
words, a place where the browser can split a line if the word is too long to fit in its
container:
        </p>

        <p>Many linguists remain unconvinced that <b>supercali<wbr>fragilistic<wbr>expialidocious</b> is indeed a word.</p>
